Constructor
------------

	1. Constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. 
	
	2. Constructor is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object(create an object).
	
	3. Constructor is called when an instance of the class is created.
	
	4. Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
	
	5. If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.
	
	6. Inside Constructor we can initialize variables.
	
	7. Constructor can be used to initialize non static data members.
	
	
Rules for creating Java Constructor
------------------------------------

	1. Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
	
	2. Constructor doesn't have return type(not even void).
	
	3. Constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized.
	

Note
-----

	1. We can use access modifiers(private, protected, public or default constructor) while declaring a constructor. 
	
	2. It controls the object creation. 
	

Types of Constructor
------------------------

	1. Default Constructor 
	---------------------------
	
		a. Default Constructor is created by compiler.
		
		b. We cannot initialize non static members with the default constructor as it provides default values(0,null).
		
		c. Default Constructor doesn't accept any arguments.
		
	2. Zero Argument Constructor
	-----------------------------
	
		a. Zero Argument Constructor is created by the programmer.
		
		b. We can initialize non static members in the body of the constructor.
		
		c. Zero Argument Constructor doesnï¿½t accept any arguments.
		
	3. Parameterized Constructor
	-----------------------------
	
		a. Parameterized Constructor is created by the programmer.
		
		b. We can initialize non static members with the help of arguments.
		
		c. Parameterized Constructor we can pass the values in the form the arguments.
		
		d. Parameterized Constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. 


Java Method/Java Constructor
-----------------------------

Java Method
------------

	1. Method is used to expose the behavior of an object.
	
	2. Method must have a return type.
	
	3. Method is invoked explicitly(called by object).
	
	4. Method is not provided by the compiler in any case.
	
	5. Method name may or may not be same as the class name.

Java Constructor
----------------

	1. Constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.	
	
	2. Constructor doesn't not have a return type.	
	
	3. Constructor is invoked implicitly(called by compiler).	
	
	4. Compiler provides a default constructor if we don't have any constructor in a class.	
	
	5. Constructor name must be same as the class name.
